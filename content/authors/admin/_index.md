    Projects:
      - Implemented a self-supervised 3D medical image denoising framework integrating slice-to-slice registration and reconstruction, combining domain expertise with machine learning. This innovation enabled clinicians to detect fine anatomical details without costly equipment while eliminating manual annotation requirements.
      - Developed a point-supervised GAN framework for generating paired images and segmentation masks, achieving accuracy comparable to fully-annotated training approaches while significantly reducing clinical annotation burden. This breakthrough enabled large-scale automation of 3D medical image segmentation.
      - Implemented an advanced noise correction system for large language model outputs using area under the margin (AUM) ranking methodologies, enhancing model performance and reliability in critical applications.

#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
